# KiCAD Symbol and Footprint Libraries

This repo contains miscellaneous KiCAD footprints and symbols used on our PCBs.

## Adding Footprints and Symbols

### Symbols

Try to make sure all symbols include a link to an available datasheet
from the manufacturer. This makes it easier to look up and reference
when you want to review a schematic.

### Footprints

3D Models are not required but if they are easily derived from an existing
one try to include it.
